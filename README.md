# International Flight Insights using Big Data on GCP

## Overview
This project leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to analyze international flight data, uncovering trends in global air travel. Using BigQuery, PySpark, and various data processing tools, the study examines airline performance, route efficiency, and passenger flow across borders.
## Technologies Used:
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **BigQuery**
- **PySpark on Dataproc**
- **Google Looker Studio**
- **Python & Pandas**
  
## Key Features:
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Employed GCP services such as BigQuery for scalable data analysis.
- **Data Processing:** Utilized PySpark on Dataproc to process extensive flight datasets and derive insights.
- **Route Analysis:** Identified high-traffic international routes and assessed their efficiency.
- **Airline Performance Metrics:** Analyzed airline punctuality, delays, and service reliability.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Developed interactive dashboards with Google Looker Studio to communicate findings effectively.

## Objectives:
- Investigate global flight data for trends and inefficiencies.
- Utilize BigQuery and PySpark for large-scale data processing.
- Determine the most and least efficient international flight routes.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance airline operations.

## Achievements:
- Processed and analyzed large-scale flight data using BigQuery and PySpark.
- Identified key international routes with the highest traffic and delays.
- Developed interactive visualizations using Google Looker Studio.
- Delivered insights on airline performance in terms of punctuality and service quality.
